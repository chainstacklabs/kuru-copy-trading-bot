# Work Items - Bot Refinement

## Master Plan

This master plan addresses artifacts, placeholders, and inconsistencies found in the core bot implementation after the WebSocket migration.

**Scope**: WebSocket event handling, multi-market support, and code quality improvements

**Approach**: Test-first development - update/create tests first, then fix implementation

## Work Items

### WI-001: Fix OrdersCanceled WebSocket Handler Field Names

**Priority**: HIGH
**Status**: TODO

**Details**:
The `OrdersCanceled` event handler uses incorrect field names compared to the API specification:
- Currently uses: `owner` field
- API spec defines: `maker_address` field
- Missing fields: `cloids[]`, `canceled_orders_data[]`

**Location**: `src/kuru_copytr_bot/connectors/websocket/kuru_ws_client.py:202-218`

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Update WebSocket client to use `maker_address` instead of `owner`
- [ ] Extract `cloids` field from event data
- [ ] Extract `canceled_orders_data` field from event data
- [ ] Update callback signature to pass all fields
- [ ] Update bot.py to handle new signature
- [ ] Update tests in `test_kuru_ws_client.py` for OrdersCanceled event
- [ ] Update tests in `test_bot.py` for order cancellation handling
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Ruff and formatting checks pass

**Test Updates Required**:
1. `tests/unit/connectors/test_kuru_ws_client.py` - OrdersCanceled event tests
2. `tests/unit/test_bot.py` - TestCopyTradingBotOrdersCanceledProcessing class

### WI-002: Add Market Filtering to Trade Event Handler

**Priority**: HIGH
**Status**: TODO

**Details**:
The `Trade` event handler does NOT filter by market_address like the `OrderCreated` handler does. This means trades from ALL markets are processed, not just the subscribed market. This can cause:
- Processing trades from unintended markets
- Incorrect order executions
- Resource waste

**Location**: `src/kuru_copytr_bot/connectors/websocket/kuru_ws_client.py:170-194`

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Add market_address extraction from Trade event data
- [ ] Add market filtering logic (compare to self.market_address)
- [ ] Log filtered trades at debug level
- [ ] Add test for Trade events from different markets (should be filtered)
- [ ] Add test for Trade events from correct market (should be processed)
- [ ] Update existing Trade event tests to include market_address field
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Verify TradeResponse model includes market field

**Test Updates Required**:
1. `tests/unit/connectors/test_kuru_ws_client.py` - Add market filtering tests
2. Check if `models/trade.py` TradeResponse has market field

### WI-003: Remove Redundant Exception Pass Statements

**Priority**: LOW
**Status**: TODO

**Details**:
Two exception handlers in bot.py have redundant `pass` statements after logging. After a logger.debug() call, the pass does nothing - the except block will exit anyway.

**Locations**:
- `src/kuru_copytr_bot/bot.py:104`
- `src/kuru_copytr_bot/bot.py:172`

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Remove `pass` statement from line 104 (Trade event handler)
- [ ] Remove `pass` statement from line 172 (OrderCreated event handler)
- [ ] Verify exception is still caught and logged properly
- [ ] All existing tests still passing (no test changes needed)
- [ ] Ruff check passes

**Test Updates Required**:
- None (code cleanup only)

---

### WI-004: Remove Placeholder Values in process_order()

**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Status**: TODO

**Details**:
The `process_order()` method creates a Trade object with placeholder values just to reuse the validator:
- `trader_address=order.market` (market address used as trader - incorrect)
- `tx_hash=""` (empty string as placeholder)

This is a code smell. The validator should either:
1. Accept Order objects directly, OR
2. Have a separate validation method for orders

**Location**: `src/kuru_copytr_bot/trading/copier.py:247-260`

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Create Order validation method in TradeValidator (e.g., `validate_order()`)
- [ ] Remove Trade object creation in process_order()
- [ ] Call validator.validate_order() with Order object directly
- [ ] Add tests for Order validation in `test_validator.py`
- [ ] Update process_order() tests to verify no placeholder Trade is created
- [ ] All tests passing

**Test Updates Required**:
1. `tests/unit/risk/test_validator.py` - Add Order validation tests
2. `tests/unit/trading/test_copier.py` - Verify process_order behavior

**Alternative Solution**:
If Order validation needs are identical to Trade validation, extract common validation logic into helper methods rather than creating fake Trade objects.

### WI-005: Support Multi-Market Operations in Bot Architecture

**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Status**: TODO

**Details**:
Bot monitors multiple markets via WebSocket but KuruClient only operates on `market_addresses[0]`. This creates a mismatch:
- WebSocket: listens to markets A, B, C
- KuruClient: can only place orders on market A
- Result: Orders from markets B and C will fail

**Location**: `src/kuru_copytr_bot/main.py:54-59`

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Pass market address to copier for each trade/order
- [ ] Update KuruClient to accept market parameter in place_order methods
- [ ] Remove hardcoded `self.contract_address` from KuruClient
- [ ] Support dynamic market switching OR create KuruClient per market
- [ ] Add test for multi-market order placement
- [ ] Add test for order placement with incorrect market (should fail gracefully)
- [ ] Update bot tests to verify market is passed correctly
- [ ] All tests passing

**Test Updates Required**:
1. `tests/unit/test_bot.py` - Verify market propagation
2. `tests/unit/trading/test_copier.py` - Verify market passed to KuruClient
3. `tests/unit/connectors/test_kuru_client.py` - Test dynamic market operations

**Design Decision Needed**:
- Option A: Create one KuruClient per market (cleaner, maintains state per market)
- Option B: Make KuruClient market-agnostic, pass market to every method (more flexible)

### WI-006: Fix OrdersCanceled Callback Signature Throughout Stack

**Priority**: HIGH
**Status**: TODO
**Depends On**: WI-001

**Details**:
After fixing WI-001 (adding cloids and canceled_orders_data fields), the callback signature will change throughout the stack:
- WebSocket client callback type
- Bot handler method signature
- All tests using the callback

This is a cascading change from WI-001.

**Locations**:
- `src/kuru_copytr_bot/connectors/websocket/kuru_ws_client.py:59`
- `src/kuru_copytr_bot/bot.py:195-267`

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Update callback type signature in WebSocket client
- [ ] Update bot's `on_orders_canceled` method signature
- [ ] Update all test mocks to use new signature
- [ ] Verify order mapping still works with new fields
- [ ] Consider using `cloids` instead of `order_ids` for tracking (more reliable)
- [ ] All tests passing

**Test Updates Required**:
1. `tests/unit/test_bot.py` - Update all OrdersCanceled test mocks
2. Mock callback signatures need cloids and canceled_orders_data parameters

---

### WI-007: Add Explicit Validation for Missing WebSocket Fields

**Priority**: LOW
**Status**: TODO

**Details**:
WebSocket event handlers use `dict.get()` with empty string defaults:
- `data.get("market_address", "")`
- `data.get("owner", "")`

Empty strings as fallbacks hide missing data issues. Should explicitly validate required fields and fail loudly if missing.

**Locations**:
- `src/kuru_copytr_bot/connectors/websocket/kuru_ws_client.py:141, 204`

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Remove default empty string values from .get() calls
- [ ] Add explicit KeyError handling for missing required fields
- [ ] Log error with full event data when field is missing
- [ ] Add tests for malformed event data (missing fields)
- [ ] Verify Pydantic models catch missing fields (OrderResponse, TradeResponse)
- [ ] All tests passing

**Test Updates Required**:
1. `tests/unit/connectors/test_kuru_ws_client.py` - Add malformed event tests
2. Test missing market_address in OrderCreated
3. Test missing maker_address in OrdersCanceled
4. Test missing required fields in Trade event
